        This weekend a group of |<i>/dev/fort</i>| alumni gathered at a secret
        location in East London|<sup id='location-footnote1'><a
        href='#footnote1'>1</a></sup>| for what we're calling
        |<i>/dev/flat</i>|: a bit like a fort, but smaller in all dimensions.
        So for two days we've been working on the projects started at
        |<i>/dev/fort</i>|s 2 & 3, moving them forward towards the ultimate
        aim of a full launch.

        One of the reasons this is valuable is that, with the benefit of some
        perspective, there are aspects of user flow, technical architecture or
        choice of restrictions that don't really make sense once we've got
        back to the wider world. This means that getting a group of people
        together to work on something yields far better insights than
        individuals hacking in their basements. It's also more social, which
        is part of the point of |<i>/dev/fort</i>| in the first place.

        This isn't the first time we've done this: a little over a year ago a
        few people from the first fort (Simon Willison, Nat Downe, Niqui
        Merret and James Aylett) got together a couple of times to hammer
        through just these kind of issues. Simon & Nat then took the baton to
        keep moving forward, closing issues, finishing or adding required
        features and so forth, to take Wildlife Near You from limited alpha
        out to its full public beta (and beyond, with new features now
        appearing regularly).

        This time round we had Hannah Donovan, Steve Marshall, Mark Norman
        Francis and Matthew Hasler working on the |<i>/dev/fort</i>| 2
        project, and George Brocklehurst, Richard Boulton and James Aylett
        working on the |<i>/dev/fort</i>| 3 project. One thing we discovered
        on both was a slight angle between the direction we'd been heading in
        during work at the fort, and the direction that makes sense in the
        cold light of day. So a lot of time was spent looking at the problem
        afresh (Hannah spent a couple of hours using herself as a guinea pig
        in an impromptu user testing lab she built in my kitchen), and then
        starting to rebuild the pieces that don't make as much sense as we
        want.

        What's become obvious as we've run a number of |<i>/dev/fort</i>|s is
        that a fort is a very good place to start projects: the isolation and
        lack of distraction provides a high velocity, and you feel free to get
        something done that makes sense at the time, without worrying so much
        about real users. Thereafter, you need some work to turn that first
        iteration into a releasable, usable website; you refine the concept,
        tidy up the user flows, fix those glaring errors, and put it live
        somewhere for more people to play with. None of this really comes as a
        surprise; technical projects almost always have to go through an
        "ideation" and experimentation phase, which can feeds into more
        detailed work on design and product definition, often running
        alongside technical work to either shore up work done in earlier
        experiments, or to lay the groundwork for a more robust system used
        from that point on.

        Forts are for prototype; flats are for product.
