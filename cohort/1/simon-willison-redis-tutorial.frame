        Regular cohort member Simon Willison has published the <redis
        tutorial> he gave at <NoSQL Europe> back in April, taking you through
        the basic operations and building up to descriptions of how to put
        them together in a number of real-world examples, including the
        <crowd-sourced best photo feature> of WildlifeNearYou.com.

        (But don't pay attention to his self-labelled "crazy idea" about
        queue-activated shell scripts; as cohort member <Richard Boulton
        points out>, this is better done using <userv>.)
