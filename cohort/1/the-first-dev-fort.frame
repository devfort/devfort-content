        Planned earlier that summer, in late November 2008 a dozen of us piled
        into a bus with wings for the flight to Alderney. Fort Clonque is a
        19th century fort now owned and maintained by The Landmark Trust, and
        served as the perfect base of operations for our week.

    The site
    
        During our time there we built <Wildlife Near You>, coming up with and
        refining the idea, designing all aspects of the site, and coding the
        whole thing. As we could perhaps have predicted, it then took a
        further three months to finish off the remaining few tasks (such as
        putting an alpha sign-up page in front of it, integrating with Flickr
        and so forth) that were impractical or forgotten while in Alderney.
        
        The site went into invitation alpha at the start of March 2009, and
        finally launched in January 2010.
