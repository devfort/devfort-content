        After a fog-bound England gave those of us flying a worryingly slow
        start, the cohort finally all convened at <Glasgow International> and
        set off in an over-sized coach (containing 13 people, seating more
        like 80) only three hours late. Our destination? <Saddell>, in the
        Kintyre Peninsula of Scotland.

        We occupied Saddell House from the 9th to the 16th of November 2009.
        If anything, this felt more remote and isolated than Fort Clonque
        did in the |<a href='/cohort/1/'>first <em>/dev/fort</em></a>|.
        
        There, amidst constant rallying cries of "Awesome!" and some
        genuine (and some ironic) high-fives, we planned and built most of
        a website.
        
    The site
        
        In what is becoming a predictable lament, the site wasn't finished
        during the week. The basic functionality was complete, but many 
        of the little details that will add polish, including an updated
        visual treatment, are yet to be rolled in.
        
        We hope to achieve an invitation-only alpha phase before the summer.
