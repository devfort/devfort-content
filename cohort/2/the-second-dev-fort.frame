        The second |<i>/dev/fort</i>| was held in Knockbrex Castle, Scotland,
        between May 30th and June 6th, 2009.

        After many hours of travel, two missed trains, a couple of pints of 
        beer and a lot of driving (the drinking and driving were separate
        people, before anyone complains), everyone converged on the castle,
        picked rooms by pointing and declaring "Yoink!" and then unpacked.

    The site
    
        A few false starts and a lot of discussion later, we found inspiration
        over dinner and (after digesting) went full-steam-ahead into the
        planning of our new website.
        
        As with the |<a href='/cohort/1/'>first <em>/dev/fort</em></a>|, we
        didn't finish it during the week and have a few remaining problems to
        iron out (including a thorny issue inside <django> itself).
        
        We hope to achieve an invitation-only alpha phase within the next
        couple of months.
