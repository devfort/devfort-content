        Imagine a place with no distractions---no IM, no Twitter, in fact no
        internet access at all. Within, you find a group of a dozen or more
        developers, designers, thinkers and doers. And a lot of a food.

        _Now imagine that place is a fort_.

        |<i>/dev/fort</i>| is <band camp> for geeks. It is a week away from
        the rest of the world to learn, to think, to play and to build. The
        aim is to make something---it could be a website, a game or a
        world-conquering robot---from scratch, in a week.
        
        But it is equally about enjoying the company and the scenery, a
        working holiday. Past forts have seen people exploring World War II
        tunnels, raising the property's flag each morning to the sound of a
        bugle, swimming out to deserted islands and investigating medieval 
        artefacts.
        
        Forts happen in isolated locations; a castle or other fortifiable
        structure (in an emergency we can use pillows) usually in an area of
        outstanding natural beauty, sometimes when it's freezing cold.
        
        |<i>/dev/fort</i>s| are enjoyable for many reasons, including:
        
    *   a holiday somewhere beautiful
    
    *   a chance to geek out for an entire week without anyone judging you
    
    *   proper home-cooked food instead of take-out for a week
    
    *   the challenge of trying to build something in about five days
    
    *   the opportunity to work with, and learn from, people with different
        skills and knowledge from yourself
    
    *   spending a week in a _fucking fort_ |<br>| 
        (but castles and country homes can be substituted for forts as
        necessary and are almost as awesome)
        
        
    Why |<i>/dev/fort</i>|?
    
        This is ultimately <Matthew Somerville>'s fault.
    
        In his presentation for <BarCamp London 4>, Matthew used photos taken
        on some of his holiday trips as placeholder images in his talk (not 
        having enough internet to find anything more suitable). <The first
        slide> was of <Fort Clonque> in Alderney. A few excitable people in
        the audience, including <James Aylett> and <Mark Norman Francis>,
        demanded to see more pictures of forts.
    
        Later, they decided that Fort Clonque would make a great venue for an
        event that they had talked about running for a while---a kind of
        extended <Hack Day>, allowing time to build something more ambitious
        with a larger group of people.
    
        The first event was jokingly named "Super Evil Dev Fort" (inspired
        by <SuperHappyDevHouse>). The name stuck, but we decided to be less
        (explicitly) evil later.
